<h3>Depths and Dangers</h3>
</center>
<p>40 years ago to this day the SS liberal went down outside of long island while it was chartering a group
 of fisherman. Everyone was able to be saved but the boat was completely lost with a lot of valuables left
 inside they have never been recovered. A group of expert scuba divers that were good friends that decided 
 it what be a good idea to try to recover anything from the shipwreck. After arriving at the boat rental place 
 they are offered different types of boats they could use for the day. They decide on a boat and set off for 
 their day. The day is beautiful with absolutely calm water. Two hours later they arrive at the wreck around 
 50 miles offshore. The depth of the ocean is surprisingly low here so they all put on their gear and hop 
 into the water like any other day.  </p>
